<h1 style="font-size: 15pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">DISCIPLINARY RULES FOR THE INMATES OF THE HOSTELS  </h1>
<ol>
<li  > Knock before you enter
<ul type="disc"><li class="style1">Knock and wait for an answer before you enter anyone's room except for your own though.</li></ul>
</li>
<li  > Greet everyone with common muslim greeting
<ul type="disc"><li class="style1">Salam alaikum and try to grab the opportunity of being the first to do that. Probably, that's one <br /> reason why Aligarians seldom give the common reply "wa- alaikum as-salaam". Even if they fail to greet first, they reply with Salam - alaikum.</li></ul>
</li>
<li  > Following the dress code everywhere.
<ul type="disc"><li class="style1">Step out of Hall/Hostel premises in Shirts, trousers and shoes. No folded sleeves. If wearing a kurta pyjama, sherwani is compulsory. The same rule applies for Dining Hall and Entertainment Room ("Common Room" as we call it).</li></ul>
</li>
<li> Black sherwani, kurta -pyjama to be worn on all important occasions and university functions.
</li>
<li >Introduction (a name given for a very mild ragging) is mandatory for all freshers even if they join university for Ph. D.
 </li>
<li > A student who spent at least 3 years is eligible to sit and watch the Introduction sessions. A 5 year senior can ask questions but a senior of 7 years or more actually leads the Intro sessions. A fresher's room-mate can never sit in his room-mate's Intro session.
 </li>
<li> If a student moves to another Hall then he has to give Introduction in the new Hall as well.
 </li>
<li > Respect the seniors (Senior students).</li>
 <li >Queues for everything and everywhere. Seniors to be given preference.
 </li>
<li>   Men can't carry or use umbrellas. They are supposedly meant for ladies. Raincoats/Rainsuits are allowed though.
 </li>
<li>  Men shouldn't be found running or panicking when it starts raining. Walk gracefully to the nearest shelter.
 </li>
 <li>  Shouldn't call dining hall attendants as waiters. Ask for their name and add "miyan" or "bhai" to their names. The idea is to treat them with complete respect.
 </li>
 <li>   "A guest is a guest". Any student's guest should be treated as a guest by all.
 </li>
 <li>  Share home-made food with room-mates and hostel mates.
 </li>
<li>On a Dhaba, Cafe or in any canteen, a senior has to pay if a senior and junior are eating together.</li>
 
</ol>
